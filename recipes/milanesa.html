        This traditional milanesa argentina recipe calls for beef round cutlets which are drenched in beaten eggs seasoned with 
        garlic, parsley, pepper, and salt, then coated in breadcrumbs and fried. In case you can't get hold of the beef round, 
        you can use beef tenderloin instead.
